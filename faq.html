                                <p><strong>How do I order from the site?</strong></p>
                                <p>Ordering from the site is very easy. When you view a product you like, click “Enquiry &amp; Order Now” and send enquiry. Next, e-mail your logo or artwork: Done!
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>What if I need my order quickly? </strong></p>
                                <p> We can meet most event dates if it is at most two weeks away. Make sure you specify the event date when ordering and we will rush your order sometimes with or without an extra cost. If we can't meet your deadline, we will notify you</p>
                                <p><strong>Can I trust you? </strong></p>
                                <p>We have worked with major brands such as Rexona, Sunlight and many others. Please check our testimonials for customer feedback. If any customer is unhappy with their order, we fix the problem – either re-issuing or refunding the order</p>
                                <p><strong>What are the order payment options?  </strong></p>
                                <p><strong>A)</strong> Wire Bank Transfer - You can set up a wire bank transfer from your bank to our world standard HSBC Corporate Account. We mostly recommend this method for large orders above USD3,000 due to high fees. We always include banking details on your order confirmation. If you wish to use PayPal, we can accept this, but you will be responsible for the transaction fee, which is around 3-4% value of the total order.</p>
                                <p><strong>B)</strong> Western Union – To those outside paying from outside Ghana, you may also use this method by visiting a WU depot anywhere in your country and transfer the funds to us. Once you place your order online, we will include our Western Union details in the order confirmation.</p>
                                <p><strong>C)</strong> Cheques to Ouverte Group Limited or Cash payment or Mobile money.</p>
                                <p><strong>What happens after I place my order? </strong></p> 
                                <p>Immediately after placing your order, we send an e-mail order confirmation; click reply to send us your artwork ASAP. Next, our art department will set up your digital proof and email it to you if necessary. Before we begin your order production, you must approve these proofs. If we need any other information from you, we will contact you about this also. Our goal is 100% customer satisfaction so we will keep you informed as to your order status throughout the process and for orders done overseas we will send you a shipping information sheet including your tracking numbers once dispatched.</p>

                                <p><strong>When can I expect delivery of my order?</strong></p>
                                <p>Most Express orders are delivered within 2-3 weeks; economy takes 5-7 weeks or more depending on the consignment. For urgent orders, we do our best to deliver in time for your requested event date and keep you updated during production. If you have any questions, please email us at the address on the order confirmation. We aim to respond within 24 hours to all email correspondence.</p>

                                <p><strong>What if I receive my order and I'm not happy? Is there a guarantee? </strong></p> 
                                <p>We do everything possible to prevent and rectify mistakes. Before we begin production, you must sign off on the digital color art-proof and pre-production proof (sample). We guarantee to deliver your order exactly as approved by these proofs and that it will arrive on time and error-free. But we are human, sometimes there may be errors. If so, on receipt of your complaint, we examine your proofs and replace either the bad ones or the entire order, or we arrange a refund of the bad ones. 99.9% of customers who complain are happy with one of these two options.</p>

                                <p><strong></strong></p>What type of artwork do you want?  
                                <p>We accept any format; png, pdf, ai, eps, psd, and Cdr. We have a professional art department who will view and convert your logo to your preferred type for free. If we have any issues with your artwork we will communicate that. If the artwork is too large you can send it to us via WeTransfer. www.wetransfer.com</p>

                                <p><strong></strong></p>Can I receive a pre-production sample before order goes into production?  
                                <p>Yes. Once production starts, we’ll take the first imprint on the first item, photograph the print and email it to you for you to review and approve or request corrections. Only when you have approved the pre-production proof will we proceed with mass production.</p>
                                 
                                <p><strong>Can I order a sample before placing an order?</strong></p>  
                                <p>Yes. We have two different sample options as stated below.</p>
                                <p>1) Digital Proof Sample:  (24 hours maximum Delivery) When you view a product, click “Enquiry &amp; Order Now” and send enquiry. Next, e-mail your logo; we will first send you quote which include shipping to be sure you are happy with product price, then our professional art department will digitally put your logo on the product and email it to you for your review and approval.</p>
                                <p>2) Delivery Sample:  To get deliver sample, also click on "Enquiry &amp; Order Now". You will need to pay for this type of sample to be delivered to you. We send you what we call a “blank sample”, is a sample without a logo on the stock. This takes approximately 12 days for delivery. If you want your logo imprinted on the sample, you will need to pay a logo set up fee and delivery will take two weeks, though this could be more depending on the product. Also, note that you will still need to pay a shipping fee if the items are being done overseas. Those who prefer to touch the sample before progressing should choose the Delivery Sample option. After viewing the sample and placing your order, you will get a refund on the setup cost of the sample. This refund excludes the shipping cost.</p>
                                 
                                <p><strong>Can I ship with my own FedEx or DHL or UPS or ARAMEX account?</strong></p>  
                                <p>No problem! Reply to the order confirmation that you wish to ship using your courier account. Make sure your delivery address is the same as that on the shipping account. DHL, FedEx or UPS or Aramex will NOT ship to a different address. 95% of the time, you may be the one to request a shipping company to come to our office to pick up the shipment. In this case, we will provide you with our full address and pick up date once the order is ready.</p>

                                <p><strong>Are there any extra hidden charges?</strong></p>
                                <p>No. What you see on the price quotation we send you is what you will pay. This includes product cost with shipping and clearing charges (if applicable), including local taxes and in some cases delivery fee.</p>

                                <p><strong>Do I have to pay sales tax?</strong></p>  
                                <p>You may need to pay local taxes on goods in Ghana. For items shipped from overseas, clearing is usually handled by Ouverte Promotions. If however, you would like to handle the clearing process yourself kindly notify us so we give you the necessary documents and information.
                                Can I order less than the minimum quantity listed on the website?  We try to offer you the lowest possible quantity. If you need less than the minimum, please use the “Add to Enquiry” for that product to make your request. We will do our best to honour your request, but cannot guarantee it.</p>

                                <p><strong>Do we accept mixed orders?</strong></p>  
                                <p>Yes. We can mix different kinds of products in one order. </p> 
                                 
                                <p><strong>Can I order this item blank/unprinted? </strong></p> 
                                <p>Yes. Inform as about your request in the enquiry. We will email you to acknowledge this request. Once confirmed, we will produce your item(s) without logos.
                                Is there discount for large quantities?  Yes! The higher the quantity ordered, the lower the price per piece as shown in price table. If you wish to discuss further discount because you want to order even greater quantities, click “Add To Enquiry”, let us know the price offer and qty. We will review and get back to you.</p>

                                <p></p>As all products are personalized, we are unable to accept returns. If you feel your order faulty in any way, we ask for proof, eg a photo or video, of your complaint. We review it and will ideally re-make the bad items or refund you.

                                <p><strong>How do I get in touch with someone if I have a problem with my order?</strong></p>
                                <p>Once you place your order online, an account manager handles the process, including any complaints you might have. We will then review it.</p>

                                <p><strong>My order arrived and the print quality is unacceptable - what do I do?</strong></p>  
                                <p>We have quality checking procedures in place to minimise the chance of products being dispatched with poor quality print. However, in the unlikely event that print quality is poor, simply contact your account manager.</p>

                                <p><strong>My order arrived and the products are damaged - what do I do? </strong></p> 
                                <p>At the time of despatch, our checking procedures ensure your products are in good condition. Should your order arrive in a damaged state, then it was likely caused during transit. If this happens, remove the damaged units and we will arrange a refund for them or replace at no extra cost.</p>

                                <p><strong>What if I receive more or less than I ordered?  </strong></p>
                                <p>We strive to ship you the exact quantity you order. However, due to occasional variations in the identification process, an underrun of an order quantity may occur. We will arrange a refund against the fewer number of units or send more at no cost to you.</p>

                                <p><strong>Can I order a sample before placing an order?  </strong></p>
                                <p>Yes. We have two different sample options as stated below.</p>
                                <p><strong>1)</strong> Digital Proof Sample:  (24 hours maximum Delivery) When you view a product, click “Enquiry & pOrder Now” and send enquiry. Next, e-mail your logo; we will first send you quote which include shipping to be sure you are happy with product price, then our professional art department will digitally put your logo on the product and email it to you for your review and approval.</p>
                                <p><strong>2)</strong> Delivery Sample:  To get a physical sample, also click on "Enquiry & Order Now". You will need to pay for this type of sample to be delivered to you. We send you what we call a “blank sample”, is a sample without a logo on the stock. This takes approximately 12 days for delivery. If you want your logo imprinted on the sample, you will need to pay a logo set up fee and delivery will take two weeks, though this could be more depending on the product. Also, note that you will still need to pay a shipping fee if the items are being done overseas.
                                Those who prefer to touch the sample before progressing should choose the Delivery Sample option. After viewing the sample and placing your order, you will get a refund on the setup cost of the sample. This refund excludes the shipping cost.</p>

                                <p><strong>What if UPS or FedEx loses my shipment?</strong></p>  
                                <p>We have used DHL for many shipments. To date, we have had no shipment lost in transit. If by chance this does happen, we will do all we can to locate your shipment. If it IS lost, DHL or FedEx will pay compensation and this may be used to re-make a new order or refund back to you. Both delivering agents have a very solid tracking system which monitor all shipments to make sure delivery to the correct location.</p>
                                <p><strong>Do I have to pay for clearance and handling fees? </strong></p>
                                <p>For items shipped from overseas, clearing and handling is usually handled by Ouverte Promotions. If however, you would like to handle the clearing process yourself kindly notify us so we give you the necessary documents and information.</p>
                                <p><strong>How will the delivery be done? </strong></p>
                                <p>Depending on your delivery address in Ghana, we process our deliveries through Ouverte Express Delivery and DHL.</p>
